Chromium exists within the Kali repositories and can be installed using:
apt-get install chromium



Chromium Won’t Launch on Kali
By default chromium won’t launch on Kali Linux, this is due to chromium running as the root user. You can fix this by opening /etc/chromium.d/default-flags in mousepad and adding the following lines:

# Run as root Kali
export CHROMIUM_FLAGS="$CHROMIUM_FLAGS --password-store=detect --no-sandbox --user-data-dir"



In order to use chromium for Web Application Penetration Testing you need to disable all the security features, allowing for DOM based XSS testing in chromium.

# Disable Chromium security features for web app testing
export CHROMIUM_FLAGS="$CHROMIUM_FLAGS --disable-web-security"



Kali Chromium Error: You Are using an Unsupported Command line flag –disable-web-security. Security and Stability will suffer
Ignore the following error, Chromium still process DOM based XSS. The same error occurs in Google Chrome.
